# TI-LaunchPad

A repo for code samples for the [TI LaunchPad](http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/tools-software/launchpads/overview/overview.page) development boards.

## Morse

A Morse code flasher, documented in my [hardware hacking](http://blog.thestateofme.com/2011/09/25/hardware-hacking/) blog post.

The construction of this project led to some very interesting analysis by [Andy Bennett](https://github.com/andyjpb), covered in my [the compiler will not save you](http://blog.thestateofme.com/2013/10/12/the-compiler-will-not-save-you/) blog post. See [EmbeddedMorse](https://github.com/cpswan/EmbeddedMorse) repo for examples with much better idiomatic C (but that don't fit onto a saml MSP440 microcontroller).
